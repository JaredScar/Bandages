# Bandages
Bandages Source
PaperBandages
The plugin was made for [this plugin request] (http://forums.bukkit.org/threads/bandages.285380/). When it is right-clicked, it heals the player by 1 heart and gives 4 seconds of regeneration II, then removes the bandage from the player's inventory. [If right-clicked on another player, they get the buff.]
